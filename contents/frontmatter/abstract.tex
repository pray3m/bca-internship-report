\chapter*{Abstract}
This internship report details my contributions to the Maison \& Architecture platform, a Hyteno-developed digital solution designed to connect clients with architects, builders, and artisans in France. The primary goal of the platform is to streamline the architectural project lifecycle by centralizing service listings, simplifying the bidding process, and enhancing user engagement. My work focused on enhancing the frontend user experience using Next.js, integrated with a NestJS and GraphQL backend, across customer, partner, and admin dashboards.

Key responsibilities included implementing ad tracking functionality to monitor user engagement and campaign effectiveness, enhancing gallery functionalities to improve the presentation of architectural projects, and developing a real-time chat system using Socket.IO to facilitate direct communication between clients and professionals. Additionally, I contributed to the development of the Leo AI Assistant, an interactive tool designed to guide users through project estimation and service booking, providing a user-friendly approach to project planning.

The report outlines the problem statement, objectives, methodologies, and challenges encountered during the internship, along with the solutions implemented to address them. The outcomes of this work include improved user functionality, performance optimizations, and adherence to accessibility standards, contributing to the overall success of the Maison \& Architecture platform and enhancing my skills in frontend development and collaborative software engineering.
