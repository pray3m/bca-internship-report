\section{Overview}

\para{
    The Maison Architecture project, developed by Hyteno, is a digital platform that helps people turn their architectural ideas into reality. It connects clients with skilled architects and builders for projects like home renovations, extensions, or new builds. The platform makes it simple to find trusted professionals for every step, from the initial idea to the final handover.

    It has three main sections:

    \noindent\textbf{Customer Dashboard:} For clients to explore professionals and manage projects.\\
    \noindent\textbf{Partner Dashboard:} For architects and builders to showcase their work and collaborate.\\
    \noindent\textbf{Admin Dashboard:} For managing the platform and ensuring smooth operations.\\

    During my internship at Hyteno, I worked as a frontend developer on all parts of the platform. I used Next.js to improve how users interact with the site, while the backend team used Nest.js and GraphQL. My tasks focused on making project posting, bidding, and admin tools easier to use. I also ensured the designs were responsive and simple for both clients and professionals.
