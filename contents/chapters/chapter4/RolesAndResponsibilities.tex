\section{Roles and Responsibilities}
During my internship at Hyteno from December 24, 2024, to February 24, 2025, I worked as a frontend developer on the Maison Architecture project. My primary goal was to enhance the platformâ€™s usability and features for both clients and professionals in the French architectural and construction sector. My key responsibilities included:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Frontend Development: Building and enhancing components using Next.js for improved user interfaces.
    \item Feature Development: Adding features like ad tracking, service ordering, project bidding, chat functionality, and the Leo assistant for project estimation and service booking.
    \item Collaboration: Coordinating with the backend and other teams to integrate my work with Nest.js and GraphQL for smooth data interaction.
    \item Usability and Responsiveness: Ensuring the platform was responsive and user-friendly for French clients, with special attention to features like the Leo assistant for guided project estimations and service bookings.
\end{itemize}
Throughout my internship, I collaborated with a talented team to make the platform more intuitive and user-focused, especially for users in France.
