\section{Description of Intern Department/Unit}
As an intern, I was part of the frontend development unit within the broader development team. This unit is responsible for designing and implementing the user interfaces of Hyteno's projects, ensuring they are responsive, accessible, and aligned with user needs.  

During my time in this department, I collaborated closely with:  
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Frontend Developers:} Who built and refined the platform's interfaces using technologies like Next.js.  
  \item \textbf{Backend Developers:} Who manage data and server-side logic using Nest.js and GraphQL.  
  \item \textbf{UI/UX Designers:} Who provided design frameworks and ensured the interfaces were visually consistent and user-friendly.  
\end{itemize}

This collaborative environment allowed me to contribute to the Maison \& Architecture project while learning from experienced professionals in the field.
