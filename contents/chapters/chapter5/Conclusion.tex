\section{Conclusion}

\para{
The Maison Architecture project, developed by Hyteno, successfully bridges the gap between French clients and architects/construction professionals. During my internship from December 24, 2024, to February 24, 2025, I contributed significantly to enhancing the frontend by working on features like ad tracking, service ordering, project bidding, real-time chat, and the Leo assistant for guided project estimations and bookings.

\para{
I worked on various dashboards—customer, partner, and admin—using Next.js and collaborating with the Nest.js/ GraphQL backend team. My contributions, such as integrating tracking features, enhancing galleries, and implementing the chat system, improved user interaction and communication within the platform. Additionally, the Leo assistant brought a valuable interactive tool that helped users estimate project costs and book services based on gathered project details.

\para{
This project meets its goal of simplifying the connection between clients and professionals in France, and my contributions provided practical value to this effort. It's rewarding to see how these features support real people in their renovation or construction projects, making the platform more user-centric and accessible.
